# Closest Points Finder ðŸš€
A Java program to calculate the two closest points from a set of user-provided 2D coordinates. Users can input any number of points, and the program identifies the closest pair based on Euclidean distance. The solution is implemented with nested loops and leverages arrays for efficient computation.

# USAGE
1. Enter the number of points you want to input.
2. Provide the x and y coordinates for each point when prompted.
3. View the closest points and their distance.
