# Smallest-2D-Distance-Finder
A Java program to calculate the two closest points from a set of user-provided 2D coordinates. Users can input any number of points, and the program identifies the closest pair based on Euclidean distance. The solution is implemented with nested loops and leverages arrays for efficient computation.
